# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 3 problems on leetcode.

**Thoughts:** Uploaded all of them to the Interview Prep repo. Valid Sudoku was alright. The time and space complexities were interesting. Move zeroes: Did it in the first try: Not bad, I guess?. Rotate Image was easy but understanding the fuck-all solution took time, but did it. 

### Day 2: April 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 5 problems on leetcode. + One hour of porject work.

**Thoughts:** Leetcod-ing was fun today. Time went by pretty quick until I got stuck by the atoi conversion question which was just plain ridiculous imo. Started the deeplearning course at 2. Pushed myself real heard. After 1.5 hours, had second thoughts if I should actually do the course or not as it felt very high-level. Anyway, created an account on Reddit and put out a post. But mostly I think I'll go ahead and finish the first course. This challenge is really helping me and I think I can do well if I keep this going.  

### Day 3: April 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems on leetcode. + Car classifier from google images.

**Thoughts:** The coding questions took time. Rewarding, to say the least. Had difficulty understanding the ML lecture from class, so watched the first 4 lectures of Killian. WIll try and finish it tomorrow. Thinking if I should squueze in another leetcode problem now. Imma try


### Day 4: April 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems on leetcode. + Finished lesson 2 of deep learning

**Thoughts:** Learned hoe to use zip, startswith(), isdigit(). As far as the course is concerned, learnt more abouut tensors, and "float" trouble haha. Found some interesting articles on data science on reddit. Bookmarked most of it. I have to somehow finish the deep learning course ASAOP and get on the next task. I feel like I can do a lot more.

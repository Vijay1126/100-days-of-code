# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 3 problems on leetcode.

**Thoughts:** Uploaded all of them to the Interview Prep repo. Valid Sudoku was alright. The time and space complexities were interesting. Rotate Image was easy but understanding the fuck-all solution took time, but did it. 

### Day 2: April 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 5 problems on leetcode. + One hour of porject work.

**Thoughts:** Started the deeplearning course at 2 AM. Finished the first lesson. 

### Day 3: April 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems on leetcode. + Car classifier from google images.

**Thoughts:** The coding questions took time. Rewarding, to say the least. Had difficulty understanding the ML lecture from class, so watched the first 4 lectures of Killian. WIll try and finish it tomorrow. 


### Day 4: April 22, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems on leetcode. + Finished lesson 2 of deep learning

**Thoughts:** Learned hoe to use zip, startswith(), isdigit(). As far as the course is concerned, learnt more abouut tensors, and "float" trouble. 


### Day 5: April 23, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 4 problems on leetcode. + Started lesson 3

**Thoughts:**  Was only able to do 40 minutes of lesson 3 today. Ended up spending hours on downloading datset from Kaggle, only to find out the file had fucking expired. Anyhow, learnt a bit about file management. Oh and figured out some stuff about project deployment as well. So let's see!


### Day 6: April 24, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Did 3 problems on leetcode. + Mayank dropped a bomb, so Firebase+NodeJS for a month. Yay!

**Thoughts:** Leetcode was fun as usual, gotta keep this up. Started iOS app development with Firebase. Looks good so far. I guess, learning a little bit of back end never hurt nobody. Sleeping early today. Big plays starting tomorrow!

### Day 7: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems on leetcode. + Designed 4 view controllers, started Auth and Database
**Thoughts:** Learned how powerful dequeue is. Damn. Did a bit of iOS dev. Sepnt a few hours trying to fix bugs. was succesfull in the end. Did lose a lot of time tho.


### Day 8: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems on leetcode. + Made the CustomLoginDemo app
**Thoughts:** Made the app with authentication support. Now have to focus on NodeJS. Deep learning is lagging but I'm hoping all this will pay off with the internship scene. Let's see.

### Day 9: April 27, 2020
